To use cerberusFL, you will need to:

1. Create a CerberusFLParticipant instance for each participant in the federated learning process.
2. Create a CerberusFLCoordinator instance and pass the list of participants to it.
3. Start the federated learning process by calling the `start_federated_learning()` method on the CerberusFLCoordinator instance.
4. Each participant will train their local model on their local data and then encrypt and submit their local model updates to the blockchain.
5. The CerberusFLCoordinator will aggregate the global model updates from all participants and update the global model.
6. The CerberusFLCoordinator will then distribute the updated global model to all participants.
